Platformer Game version 11.0

UPDATES:
1. Camera class tweaked to obtain smooth effect.
   
TO-DO:
1. add multiple background layers and enable parallax scrolling effect.
2. add interesting and scintillating player abilities such as:
    a. teleport and stealth attacks;
    b. during tough battles, player can create a clone of itself,
       or summon some creatures to help easily ward off enemy attacks.
3. player respawns some distance from where it died (my player shouldn't die yet, üòè.) 
4. change the enemies position as player enters a new level ( when my laptop is charged, I'll set that using Tiled)
5. player's health and energy are restored only when
   none of the active enemies are nearby
